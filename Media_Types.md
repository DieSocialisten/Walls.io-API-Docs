# Media types

Walls.io posts have different media types and you can limit your search to these types using the `media_types` parameter. 

Valid media types are:
- `text`: Posts that contain a `comment`, but no image or video.
- `image`: Posts that contain a `post_image`, but no video. However, the `comment` field is still allowed in this media type.
- `video`: Posts that contain a `post_video`. All other fields are also allowed in this media type, as long as it has a video.
