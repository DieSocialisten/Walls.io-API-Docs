#### Q: How do I get a Walls.io access token?
A: In order to use the Walls.io API for your wall, you need to be on the [Premium plan]. If you are a Premium user, you can create an access token in your Wall's settings, which can be edited in the [Walls.io backend]. Look for "API Access Token" and click "Create new access token".
